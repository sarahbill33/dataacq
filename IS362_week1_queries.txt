1A.How many airplanes have listed speeds? 

--> Answer: 23

SELECT manufacturer, model, speed
FROM planes
WHERE speed IS NOT NULL

1B.What is the minimum listed speed and the maximum listed speed?

--> Answer: Min is 90, Max is 432

SELECT manufacturer, model, MIN(speed), MAX(speed)
FROM planes
WHERE speed IS NOT NULL

2A.What is the total distance flown by all of the planes in
January 2013? 

--> Answer: 27,188,805

SELECT SUM(distance)
FROM flights
WHERE year = 2013
AND month = 1

2B.What is the total distance flown by all of
the planes in January 2013 where the tailnum is
missing?

--> Answer: 81,763

SELECT SUM(distance)
FROM flights
WHERE year = 2013
AND month = 1
AND tailnum = ""


3A. What is the total distance flown for all planes on July 5,
2013 grouped by aircraft manufacturer? Write this
statement first using an INNER JOIN

--> Answer: 755,337

SELECT planes.manufacturer, SUM(flights.distance)
FROM flights
INNER JOIN planes ON flights.tailnum = planes.tailnum
WHERE flights.year = 2013
AND flights.month = 7
AND flights.day = 5
GROUP BY planes.manufacturer WITH ROLLUP


3B.then using a LEFT
OUTER JOIN. 

--> Answer: 883,008

SELECT planes.manufacturer, SUM(flights.distance)
FROM flights
LEFT OUTER JOIN planes ON flights.tailnum = planes.tailnum
WHERE flights.year = 2013
AND flights.month = 7
AND flights.day = 5
GROUP BY planes.manufacturer WITH ROLLUP


3C.How do your results compare?

--> Answer: The left outer join included null value manufacturers, and therefore reported a higher number

4. Write and answer at least one question of your own
choosing that joins information from at least three of
the tables in the flights database.

Question: Which airport had the most originating flights for Boeng planes in 2013?

Answer --> Newark Liberty International

SELECT airports.name, COUNT(flights.flight)

JOIN planes ON flights.tailnum = planes.tailnum
JOIN airports ON airports.faa = flights.origin
WHERE planes.manufacturer = "BOEING"
GROUP BY airports.name
